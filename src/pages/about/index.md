I am a US born, UK based Web Developer specializing in building Front End functionality for web sites and applications. I have worked in this field since 2008 and built web sites for light, medium, and heavy traffic sites, as well as greenfield software solutions.

My experience has included working on small teams that have grown into large ones, as well as working independently on employer projects and freelance client work.

Currently, I am a Senior UI Developer for a global tech company migrating a legacy management console to a single-page application using TypeScript, React, and GraphQL.

Prior to my current role, I was the Head of Software Development managing a small team of software developers building products in the Network Security space. I was 100% hands-on, and was responsible for 100% of the Front End code, but also had responsibilities in both the Full Stack, and Management worlds.
